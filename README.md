ðŸ¤¯:
This Is My MERN Stack Startup Project. In This Project I Have Developed a Currency Converting Application With React JS , Express JS, Taildiwnd CSS and Mongodb Database and Some Node Js. Here i have Used Vite to Fast My React Developments.

## Getting Started ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¦:

First, clone this to your system and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `client/src/app.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file. You can edit the backend side ny modifying `/server/src/index.js`

## Thank You ! :zap:
